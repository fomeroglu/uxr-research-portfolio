-- Sortation Platform — SQL Analysis
-- Written in Google BigQuery SQL
-- These queries were used to identify workflow bottlenecks,
-- validate process improvements, and measure adoption of
-- changes across facilities.
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- Q1: Throughput by station and facility
-- Business question: How many packages per hour is each
-- weight & dim station processing? Which facilities are
-- underperforming relative to the network average?
-- Decision: Established baseline before workflow changes.
-- Identified which facilities needed prioritized rollout.

-- Q2: Dwell time between stages — where are packages stalling?
-- Business question: How long does a package spend between
-- each stage of the sortation process? Which stage has the
-- highest dwell time?
-- Decision: Confirmed weight & dim was the primary bottleneck,
-- not containerization or staging as initially assumed.

-- Business question: What percentage of volume at each
-- facility is made up of package types affected by the
-- manual measurement mode improvement (flats, envelopes, polybags)?
-- Decision: Quantified the business case for manual measurement mode.
-- Facilities with higher flat/envelope volume had the most
-- to gain from the improvement.

-- Business question: What percentage of packages complete
-- all required scan stages? Which facilities have operators
-- skipping steps?
-- Decision: Identified facilities with low scan completion
-- as candidates for operator training and workflow review.
-- A low completion rate indicated process friction, not
-- just volume issues.

-- Decision: Used to validate each release in pilot facilities
-- before broader rollout. If adoption was low or throughput
-- unchanged, we investigated before expanding.
